The character object has the following format:
{
	characterName : String,
	playerName : String,
	regiment : Object,
	specialty : Object,
	description : string,
	demeanor : String,
	skills : Object
	talents-traits : Array,
	equipment : Object
	insanity : Object,
	mutation : Object,
	psychicPowers : Object,
	comrade : Object,
	aptitudes : Array,
	experience : Object
}

Because the specialty and regiment are meant to be combined to determine the statistics of the character, they both
share the same format to allow for easy combination of their values:
{
	name : String,
	source : String	//In the future will allow for filtering based on sources for easier searching or per-game limits on content
	fixed modifiers : {	//These are the values for the modifier that are set.
		characteristics : { //Modifiers to the characteristics of the character.
			name : value	//Name of the characteristic and the modifier amount
		},
		skills : {	//The skills provided
			name : value	//Name of the skill and amount of bonus: 0, +10, +20, +30
		},
		talents : [	//The talentss provided
		],
		special abilities : [	//Special traits and abilities
			{
				name : String,
				description : String
			}
		],
		aptitudes : [	//The aptitudes provided
			name
		],
		wounds : Number,	//Integer wounds modifier
		character kit : {	//Equipment provided
			weapons : {
				main weapon : name,	//The main regimental weapon
				other weapons : name	//All other weapons
			},
			armor : [
				name
			],
			other gear : [
				name
			],
			squad : [	//Items that are provided to the entire squad, rather than the character

			]
		},
		favored weapons : [
			name
		]
	},
	optional modifiers : [	//These are values where the user must decide from a set of options allowed. After selection, the selected values are moved into the fixed modifiers
		{	//A selection object defines semantics for choosing between options. Decomposes into an array containing the selected elements, when the number of selected elements equals selectionCount and each selection exists within options.
			selectionCount : Number,	//The number of options to choose.
			selection time : String,	//When the choice is made; Character for character creation, Regiment for regiment creation.
			options : [		//The options to chose from.
				[	//Each option is an array.
					{	// Each option array contains one or more value objects
						propertyNames : [	//Array of nested property names. Determines the property that associated values will be placed under when selected.
							name
						],
						value :	Any	//The value to insert into the defined location; type is whatever is appropriate to destination.
					}
				]
			]
		}
	]
}

When creating a regiment, each regiment modifier uses the same layout as the precreated regiment and specialty format,
with rules for how to combine them once all the modifiers have been selected and it is time to combine them into a single regiment.
{
	name : String,
	source : String, //Source of created regiment is "custom"
	fixed modifiers : {
		characteristics : {], //When combining characteristics, the values of each key in all the modifiers are summed
		skills : {},	//The values of skills are added together
		talents : [],	//The talents provided are combined. In the case of duplicates, the xp bonus is increased by 100
		special abilities : []	//Combined
		aptitudes : [],	//Combined together. For each duplicate, the character gains a bonus aptitude selection.
		wounds : Number,	//Added together
		character kit : {
			weapons : {
				main weapon : name,	//Replaces the starting main weapon
				other weapons : name	//Adds to existing weapons
			},
			armor : [	//Replaced starting armor
				name
			],
			other gear : [	//Adds to other gear
				name
			],
			squad : [	//Adds to squad gear

			]
		},
		favored weapons : [
			name
		]
	},
	optional modifiers : [
		{
		}
	]
}
